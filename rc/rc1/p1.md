# Project 1

## Ex. 1 Simulation

1. Use arrays to store the positions of cars in four directions.
2. For each time unit, update the positions of cars and the light status.
   * Check whether there are cars arriving at the cross road.
   * Check the light status if necessary.
   * Check whether there is a crash.
   * Decide rules to update positions of cars in the next time unit.

## Ex. 1 Animation

1. Use iteration to draw a series of figures.
2. Useful commands:
   * `plot`
   * `rectangle`
   * `pause`
   * `axis`

## Grading

### Ex.1

1. Specific up to each updating rule and drawing.
